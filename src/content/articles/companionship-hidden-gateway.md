<div class="basmala-block">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</div>

All praise is due to Allāh, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate, the One perfect in His Majesty, the One exalted in His Names and Attributes. We praise Him with a praise that befits His greatness, His perfection, and His supreme authority.

We praise Him for the blessing of Islām. We praise Him for the blessing of guidance. We praise Him for the blessing of clarity after confusion. We praise Him for protecting hearts from deviation and souls from destruction.

Whoever He guides, none can lead him astray, and whoever He sends astray, none can guide him. We seek His aid, His forgiveness, and His protection from the trials that misguide hearts, from the whispers that corrupt intentions, and from the influences that distort perception.

We send abundant blessings and salutations upon the Beloved Prophet Muḥammad ﷺ, the conveyor of revelation, the teacher of mankind, the one through whom Allāh illuminated darkness, dispelled ignorance, and established the path of salvation. May Allāh’s peace and blessings be upon him, upon his noble family, upon his Companions — those purified souls who carried this religion with sincerity and sacrifice — and upon those who follow them in righteousness until the establishment of the Hour.

## Opening Reflection

O servants of Allāh, among the most subtle yet most dangerous realities of human existence is that the heart is impressionable. The heart is not a stone. The intellect is not isolated. The soul is not immune.

Influence enters quietly. Rarely does deviation arrive announcing itself. Rarely does falsehood declare its danger openly. Rarely does corruption present itself as corruption. Rather, change begins gradually—through familiarity, through comfort, through companionship, and through repeated exposure.

What was once rejected becomes tolerated. What was once feared becomes normalized. What was once questioned becomes defended. This is the nature of human influence. A person imagines himself strong, independent, unaffected. Yet history, experience, and revelation testify otherwise. Hearts drift. Convictions soften. Standards erode. And this often happens not through argumentation—but through association.

For companionship is not a passive affair. Companionship is transmission. Transmission of thought, values, sensitivities, and tolerances. No one sits with a people without inheriting something from them. Even silence influences. Even observation shapes. Even presence transforms.

For this reason, the religion of Allāh did not leave this affair neglected. For this reason, the Messenger ﷺ warned. For this reason, the Companions cautioned. For this reason, the Salaf spoke with precision, wisdom, and unwavering clarity.

### Assessing the Creed by Association

Yaḥyā bin Saʿīd al-Qaṭṭān [d.198H, raḥimahullāh] said: When Sufyān al-Thawrī [d.161AH] came to Baṣrah he began to look into the affair of al-Rabīʿ bin Subayh and the people’s estimation of him. He asked them, “What is his madhhab?”, and they said, “His madhhab is but the Sunnah.” He then asked, “Who are his companions?” and they replied, “The people of Qadr”, so he replied, “In that case he is a Qadari.” (Al-Ibānah 2/453)

Ibn Baṭṭah [d.387AH] commented on this:

<div class="scholar-quote">
  <div class="source">Ibn Baṭṭah — Al-Ibānah</div>
  <div class="quote-text">
    Allāh’s mercy be upon Sufyān al-Thawrī. He has indeed spoken with wisdom and he spoke the truth. He spoke with knowledge that is in agreement with the Book and the Sunnah and what is necessitated by wisdom and what the people of sure insight know. Allāh the Exalted said: “O you who believe! Take not as (your) bitânah (intimate friendship) those other than you (outside your religion or upon other than the right way) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely.” (3:118).
  </div>
</div>

Abū Dawūd al-Sijistānee [d.273AH] said: I said to Abū Abd Allāh Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal [d.241AH]: "I see a man from Ahlus-Sunnah with a man from Ahlil-bidʿah. Shall I leave his speaking to him? He said, “No, inform him that the man that you saw him with is a person of innovation, so if he leaves him, then speak to him, otherwise treat him the same as him, as Ibn Masʿūd said, ‘A man is like his companion’.” (Ṭabaqāt al-Ḥanābilah 1/160).

## The Consensus of the Scholars

The Consensus (Ijmāʿ) of the scholars in their enmity towards Ahlul-bidʿah and agreement upon boycotting them:

### Refusing to Hear from Innovators

Muḥammad Ibn Sīrīn [d.110H] was approached by two men from the People of Desires who said: “O Abu Bakr, we wish to talk to you about some matters.” He replied: “No.” They said: “Then shall we recite a verse from Allāh’s Book to you?” He responded: “No! Either you will get up and leave or I shall get up and leave!” (Al-Ibānah no. 407)

Similarly, a man from the People of Desires said to Ayyūb as-Sakhtiyānī (d. 131H): “O Abu Bakr! I would like to ask you about a word.” Ayyūb replied whilst illustrating with his index finger: “Not even half a word! Not even half a word!” (Al-Ibānah no. 426)

When it was said to al-Awzāʿī (d. 157H) that a man says: "I sit with ahlus-Sunnah and with ahlul-Bidʿah," al-Awzāʿī responded: “This man wants to equate truth with falsehood.” (Al-Ibānah no. 441)

### The Instruction of the Generations

Thābit Ibn ʿAjlān said: “I reached Anas Ibn Mālik [d.93H], Saʿīd Ibn al-Musayyib (d. 94H), al-Hasan al-Basrī (d. 110H), Saʿīd Ibn Jubair (d. 95H), ʿĀmir Ibn Sharāḥīl ash-Shaʿbī (d. 104H), Ibrāhīm an-Nakhaʾī (d. 96H), ʿAtāʾ Ibn Abī Rabāh (d. 114H), Tāwūs Ibn Kaysān al-Yamānī (d. 106H), Mujāhid Ibn Jabr al-Makkī (d. 104H), ʿAbdullāh Ibn Abī Mulaikah (d. 117H), Muḥammad Ibn Shihāb az-Zuhrī (d. 124H), Makhūl Ibn Abī Muslim ash-Shāmī (d. 112H), al-Qāsim Abū ʿAbdur-Rahmān ad-Dimashqī (d. 112H), ʿAtāʾ Ibn Abī Muslim al-Khurasānī (d. 135H), Thābit al-Bunānī (d. 127H), al-Hakam Ibn ʿUtbah (d. 113H), Ayyūb as-Sakhtiyānī (d. 131H), Hammād Ibn Salamah as-Sāʿidī (d. 120H), Muhammad Ibn Sīrīn (d. 110H)... all of them instructed me to stick to the Jamāʿah and all of them prohibited me from the People of Desires.” (Reported by Al-Lālikāʾī)

<div class="conclusion">
  <h3>Closing Reflection</h3>
  <p>O servants of Allāh, reflect deeply. Most people do not recognize change while it is happening. Deviation rarely feels like deviation at its beginning. It feels like understanding, tolerance, broad-mindedness, friendliness, or social ease.</p>
  <p>A person imagines: “I am not influenced.” “I know my limits.” “I am strong.” “I can sit with anyone.” Yet hearts are not machines. Hearts absorb, adapt, and incline. Repeated exposure reshapes sensitivities.</p>
  <p>The dangerous reality is this: the heart grows accustomed before it grows convinced. Falsehood becomes less disturbing. Innovation becomes less alarming. Deviation becomes less serious. Until eventually, the abnormal feels normal, and the normal feels extreme. This is the silent erosion of certainty.</p>
  <p>Understand something critical: bad companionship does not merely transmit ideas. It transmits attitudes, comfort zones, moral tolerances, and perception shifts. Even if belief remains intact, sensitivity weakens. And once sensitivity weakens, protection collapses.</p>
  <p>The wise person is not the one who reacts after corruption. The wise person is the one who prevents corruption. Do not wait until doubt enters. Do not wait until confusion spreads. Do not wait until the heart softens toward deviation. Guard your environment. Guard your gatherings. Guard your influences.</p>
  <p>Seek companionship that increases reverence, stability, humility, and attachment to the Sunnah. Remain with the Jamāʿah — the scholars grounded upon the narrations, the people of clarity, the inheritors of prophetic guidance. For safety lies not in intelligence alone. Safety lies in protection. And protection lies in righteous association.</p>
  <p>May Allāh preserve our hearts, protect us from silent deviation, and grant us righteous companions.</p>
  <p>Wa as-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuhu.</p>
